    Foreign Interference is a developing issue facing democracy across the globe. Authoritarian regimes have leveraged the information networks of social media to influence and destabilize autonomous democracies. This issue spans Russian interference in US elections (Hosenball, 2020), the development of digital mobs in the Philippines (Ressa, 2023), the spread of climate denialism (Chavalarias et al., 2023), and the spread of Chinese propaganda networks.

    Through analyzing the collected dataset of known Chinese State Agents, I hope to gain insight into the behavior, spread, and strength of these networks.
